# AIO

Special thanks to:

Builtbybel https://github.com/builtbybel, massgravel https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts,
slavanap https://github.com/slavanap/Windows10ManualUpdate
and offcource darius-vr https://github.com/darius-vr
for the code, files and basis to work from.

most of the code is still "Dirty" due to learning cmd, bat, vbs and ps1 creation from the ground up.

Hope this will become an excelent toolkit for everyone in the future.
