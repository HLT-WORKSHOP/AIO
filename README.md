massgravel https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts,
slavanap https://github.com/slavanap/Windows10ManualUpdate,
and offcource darius-vr https://github.com/darius-vr;
for the code, files and basis to work from. 
Any issues please direct it at the issues section of github and we will adress it as soon as possible.
Any ideas of how we could improve add a pull request and start a discussion, any idea is welcome.
Made use of O&OShutup for extra preset telemetry fixes.
Used SNAPPY DRIVER INSTALLER as a driver update medium.

Most of the code is still "Dirty" due to learning cmd, bat, vbs and ps1 creation from the ground up.

Hope this will become an excelent toolkit for everyone in the future.
